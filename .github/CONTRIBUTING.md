## Development

The development is pretty easy.

Fork the project or `git clone https://github.com/vuemontreal/vuemontreal.git`

```

npm install

npm run dev

# or

npm run build
```

And that's it !

## Architecture

We are using [Vuepress](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/) behind the scene and plugins.

The start is on [config.js](https://github.com/vuemontreal/vuemontreal/tree/master/blog/.vuepress/config.js). What you should know here is the
`require('./plugin')`.

The principal logic of the "blog is here".

I will just explain the steps and will let you test the code:

- `find` the files and return them in an array in files
- `filesExtractedDatas` will read data from archives and return them with different path to build the additionalPages for Vuepress and the archives sidebar
- `pages` we will build additionnals pages invoke ui components. (See after for the ui aspect)
- and finally we create a sidebar and link those files to it with `createdSidebar`

## Ui aspects

Actually in the [Components](https://github.com/vuemontreal/vuemontreal/tree/master/blog/.vuepress/components/) folder. You will have the parent layout [meetup.vue](https://github.com/vuemontreal/vuemontreal/tree/master/blog/.vuepress/components/meetup.vue) and a children [person.vue](https://github.com/vuemontreal/vuemontreal/tree/master/blog/.vuepress/components/person.vue).

Actually we are using index.styl to override style. But it should be update to let component be responsible of their style.
